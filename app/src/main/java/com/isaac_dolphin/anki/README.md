        Write UI tests for flashcard and deck management.

Phase 3: Spaced Repetition and Review Mode (Weeks 5-7)

    Week 5:
        Research and choose a spaced repetition algorithm (simplified Leitner or similar).
        Implement the algorithm in Kotlin.
        Write unit tests for the algorithm.
    Week 6:
        Design and implement UI for review mode.
        Connect review mode to Firestore.
    Week 7:
        Integrate spaced repetition algorithm with review mode.
        Implement rating system ("Easy," "Medium," "Hard") and update Firestore accordingly.
        Write UI tests for review mode.

Phase 4: Notifications and Basic Progress Tracking (Weeks 8-9)

    Week 8:
        Integrate Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for notifications.
        Implement notification scheduling based on spaced repetition.
        Allow users to customize notification settings.
    Week 9:
        Implement basic progress tracking (e.g., correct/incorrect answers).
        Design and implement UI for displaying progress.

Phase 5: AI Enhancements (Weeks 10-13)

    Week 10:
        Choose an AI feature to implement first (e.g., personalized learning path or question generation).
        Research and choose an appropriate ML model or API (e.g., Google Cloud Natural Language API).
    Week 11-12:
        Implement the chosen AI feature.
        Integrate the AI feature with the flashcard app.
        Write tests for the AI feature.
    Week 13:
        If time permits, start implementing a second AI feature.

Phase 6: Testing, Refinement, and Documentation (Weeks 14-16)

    Week 14-15:
        Thorough testing of all features, including AI enhancements.
        UI/UX refinement based on testing feedback.
